# This file is a placeholder for domain model tests.
# Currently, the domain models are simple data classes with no
# business logic, so there are no tests to write.

# Example of a test that could be added if a model had logic:
#
# from mqi_communicator.domain.models import Case, CaseStatus
#
# def test_case_can_be_queued():
#     case = Case(...)
#     case.queue() # Assuming a method like this exists
#     assert case.status == CaseStatus.QUEUED

pass
